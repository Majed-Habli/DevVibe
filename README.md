<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  DevSwipe is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React-Native app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). React-Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
