<!-- Prototyping -->
<img src="./readme/demo/title3.svg"/>

> We created three seperate platforms, each with a goal in mind.
> The website's intended use is for the users to register and manage their profiles, as well as stay up to date on their analytics.
> The Desk app's intended use is for the admin to be able to maintain their user base, as well as check up on their data.
> The mobile app's intended use is for the users to be able to interact with each other, swiping, viewing picks and getting background information about them.

<!-- Implementation -->
